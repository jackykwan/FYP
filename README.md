# FYP22/23_Mobile POS system with digital receipt

## Project Description
Welcome to the repository for my Final Year Project (Mobile POS system with digital receipt). This project aims to provide retailers and customers a lightweight and affordable mobile application. Small businesses can improve their overall performance while customers can enjoy a seamless transaction process. It was developed as part of my undergraduate studies in software development at the City University of Hong Kong.

This feature allows users to checkout using QR-code payment. Users can simply scan a QR code displayed at a merchant's point of sale, eliminating the need to manually enter payment details or carry physical payment cards.

- **Feature 2: digital receipt** <br />
The digital receipts feature provides users with convenient and paperless receipts for their transactions. With this feature, users can receive and store receipts electronically in the app, eliminating the need for physical copies and enabling easy access to transaction details.
